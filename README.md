# Morse Code Solver

WinForms program to solve the morse code module in the roblox game "Defusal", which is inspired from the game "keep talking and nobody explodes"

How to use:
 - enter bomb serial number where prompted
 - press the start timer button to start recording in 3 seconds, stop when no longer needed
 - it is recommended to record for a full word (aka one whole word duration)
 - words are separated by "|"

How to download (i think idk):
 - copy this repo to visual studio or vscode or smth i think
 - build it or just run it normally


too lazy to append this to previous defusal winforms app repo thing
also i dont think i should have tried to upload the whole exe for the last one...

todo: add demo video (also for the other one)
